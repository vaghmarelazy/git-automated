### You're Done ðŸŽ‰

## Script Workflow
1. **Repository Initialization** :
    - Checks if a Git repository is initialized. If not, it initializes one.
2. **Remote URL Management** :
    - Checks if the remote `origin` exists. If it does, it updates the URL if a new one is provided.
    - If the remote `origin` does not exist, it adds the provided URL as the remote repository.
3. **Commit and Push** :
    - Adds all changes, commits them with the provided message, and pushes them to the `main` branch on GitHub.


## Troubleshooting
- __Permissions denied__ : 
    - Ensure the script is executable. Use `chmod +x git-upload.sh` in Unix-like environments.
- __Git Command Not Found__:
    - Make sure Git is installed and available in your system's PATH.
- __URL Already Exists__ :
    - The script updates the existing remote URL if necessary. If you encounter issues, verify the URL configuration using `git remote -v`.
